title: 'Roofing Maintenance '
---
It is a common misconception that a roof can last for 20-30 years without any maintenance. Ideally, a homeowner should at least do an inspection of the roof once a year. A yearly inspection will be a good indicator of issues that arise with the roof which could lead to a much more cost effective repair rather than replacement. Here are some things to be on the lookout for while inspecting your roof:

**Metal:** 

* Check all screws to see if they have started to back out and come loose
* Check all penetrations sticking through the roof, make sure all boot flashing's are tight and sealed. 
* Check all sealants to make sure they are not rotting from the sun.
* Look for any new holes from debris, ect. that may allow water to get through. 
* Check ridge cap to make sure foam enclosures underneath are still in place and tight. 

**TPO:**

* Look for any tears in the material that could be caused from debris such as trees, satellite dishes, or solar panels. 
* Check around the perimeter of the roof looking for any termination bar, stucco stop, or z-flashing that could have started to pull away from parapet wall. 
* Check around all pipe penetrations, skylights, A/C ducting, and canales to make sure boots and flashing's are still tight and sealed with proper caulking. 
* Check all canales and/or catch cans (gutters) making sure they are free of debris and will allow for proper drainage. 

**Shingles:**

* Check for any torn or folded shingles due to high winds. 
* Look for any shingles that have pulled up away from the nails or any shingles that have blown off. 
* Check the shingles themselves for the amount of granules left. The less granules, the less protection left on the roof. 
* Check all pipe penetrations making sure there is no place water will be able to get into. Also checking for proper amount of tar or caulking on eposed nails or around pipe flashing. 
* Check around the A/C making sure it has not rusted through which could also cause a leak. 
* Do not drain A/C unit onto shingles, or allow A/C unit to be constantly leaking onto shingles. This will drastically decrease the life of the shingles and could potentially cause decking to rot.
